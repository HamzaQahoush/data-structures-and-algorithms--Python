# Merge Sort Algorithm


# Challenge Summary
## Implemnting merge sort 

Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting algorithms. It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer. Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

## Approach & Efficiency
Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm and time complexity can be expressed 

• Time: O(log n)


• Space: O(n)
we have to store the elements somewhere. Additional space complexity can be O(n) in an implementation using arrays .
