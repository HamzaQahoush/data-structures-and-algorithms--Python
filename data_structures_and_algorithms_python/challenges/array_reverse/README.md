Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency:

The approach : when we deal with array mostly we need to iterate on it , and If I want to loop on it normally it gave me same order , I thought about using -index and stotr it list..
Big O for time o(n) because it depends on input value iterated. And the space o(1) because I used one variable and then returned it.
