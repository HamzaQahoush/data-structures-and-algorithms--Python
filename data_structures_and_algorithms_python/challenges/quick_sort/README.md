## Approach & Efficiency
• Quick Sort Time Complexity

-Partition of elements take n time

-And in quicksort problem is divide by the factor 2

-Best Time Complexity : O(nlogn)

-Average Time Complexity : O(nlogn)

-Worst Time Complexity : O(n^2)

-Worst Case will happen when array is sorted

• Quick Sort Space Complexity

-O(n) : basic approach
-O(logn) : modified approach which we followed


## Solution
Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays. A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.
