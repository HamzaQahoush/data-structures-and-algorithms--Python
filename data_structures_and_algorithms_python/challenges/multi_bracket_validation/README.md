## Approach & Efficiency

we used regex to cover all wrong values and we check the correct values by its count if it similar

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Solution

we used regex to cover wrong cases , we import regex.
define a function which take an input
assume the default value to false
check the input if the count of each bracket are equal .
then we covered the wrong cases using regex. return false
and lastly return true for the correct value
